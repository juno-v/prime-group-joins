In this challenge, weâ€™re going to practice performing SQL queries with multiple tables. This should help better solidify some concepts that were covered during lecture.

# Prerequisites 

* A PostgreSQL client (Postico was used for this project *https://eggerapps.at/postico/*)
* Postgres is currently running on your computer

# Setup
Follow the instructions below before continuing with this challenge.

## Create your database, table, and data

1. Open Postico, if needed
2. Connect to your server, if needed
3. Create a `warehouse` database
4. Click on the `OK` tab/button to save your database
5. Open the SQL editor and copy and paste the queries from the [data.sql](/data.sql) file

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
See a diagram of the available entities and their relationships. https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1eA7JJtCVDL0K45aVzbxIUrgWXHoKY5vv1jAhssC2c1A/edit
